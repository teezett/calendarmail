= Requirements for CalendarMail

This document describes the requirements of <<index.adoc#,project CalendarMail>>.

[[section-goals]]
== Goals

The intention of this project is to solve the following goals:

* Fetch calendar information from different CalDAV locations
* Filter events for a given period
* Regularly send email reminders containing a summary of the following events


[[section-domain-model]]
== Domain Model

[glossary]
Remote Calendar::
A calendar in iCal format on a server, available via CalDAV protocol.
Reminder::
A scheduled job to be triggered regularly to filter calendar events and to send a email summary.
Email Server::
Email Server configuration to be used to send reminder emails.
System Manager[[actor-sys-man]]::
A person to invoke the program from a commandline.
Cron job[[actor-cron-job]]::
A Unix cron job to execute a program in a repeated manner.
Scheduler[[actor-scheduler]]::
A program part that triggers jobs to be executed at a time when it is configured.


[[section-usecase-overview]]
== Use Case Overview

For the software the following use cases have been identified:
