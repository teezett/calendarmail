This application is a server application to fetch events from CalDAV calenders regularly and send summary emails to a list of receivers.
It was developed within a living project called http://www.heinersyndikat.de[Heinersyndikat].

== Installation

=== Getting the source code

Clone the application repository using git:

 $ git clone https://github.com/teezett/calendarmail.git

=== Requirements

As the documentation is generated using asciidoc, the maven pom.xml relies on the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/[asciidoctor maven plugin].
As the documentation contains diagrams generated with http://de.plantuml.com/[PlantUML], asciidoctor uses the +asciidoctor-diagram+ extension.
PlantUML needs the http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz dot] tool available in the local path to render the diagrams.

==== On JRuby dependency

Asciidoctor Maven plugin relies on https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[asciidoctor] project to do the actual rendering. This is a Ruby implementation integrated thanks to the http://jruby.org/[JRuby] project, which is a required dependency to run the plugin. The maven plugin provides a default version of the `jruby-complete` artifact to ease its configuration. However, it can be overwritten just adding a custom version in the plugin's dependency section as seen in the following example:
[source,xml,indent=2]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.asciidoctor</groupId>
    <artifactId>asciidoctor-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${asciidoctor.maven.plugin.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jruby</groupId>
            <artifactId>jruby-complete</artifactId>
            <version>${jruby.version}</version>
        </dependency>
    <dependencies>
</plugin>
